# My_Project_2023_Data_Jobs_Analysis
## Project Overview
As an aspiring data analyst and former job seeker, I created this project to provide valuable insights into data-related careers. By analyzing it using my skills in Excel (Power Query, Data Analysis Tool), ETL, Power BI (DAX, Data Visualization), and Structured Query Language (SQL). The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from GitHub Luke Barousse, I explored key aspects such as the types of available data jobs, required technical skills, optimal times to apply, the correlation between skills and salary, and popular job posting platforms.

- â€¢	ChatGPT: For Improving Sentence and getting better suggestions and recommendations.

### Extract Transform and Load Data Using Excel
Extract 
- The data was extracted by downloading it from GitHub and importing it into an Excel workbook.

Transform
The data was transformed using Excel's Power Query for cleaning. This includes:
- Removing Duplicates
- Standardize Data 
- Removing Blank and Null data
- Removing Unnecessary Data

Tables Used:
Job_data table

### Explanatory Data Analysis Using SQL Server Management

- I created a database and then used the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard to import the datasets from the Excel file.

~~~
-- Creating Database

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS data_jobs_eda_project;


CREATE DATABASE data_jobs_eda_project;
~~~

-	To optimize performance, I created an index for faster and more efficient querying, as the dataset contained a large volume of data and takes minutes to load.

~~~
-- Creating an index for table data_jobs and jobs_skills for faster joins and querying

CREATE INDEX idx_job_table ON data_jobs (job_id, job_title_short, _salary_year_avg, _salary_hour_avg, job_setup)
CREATE INDEX idx_job_id_jobs_skills ON jobs_skills (job_id);

Effect of Insights:
- Focusing on LinkedIn increases your access to a broader range of jobs, but also exposes you to higher competition from other applicants. Using platforms with fewer listings, such as Ladders and Snagajob, may lead to less competition, potentially improving your chances for roles with fewer applicants.

Recommended Actions:
-	Primary Focus: Prioritize applying on LinkedIn, leveraging its extensive network and job listings for data-related roles, or Explore Ladders and Snagajob to identify hidden opportunities with less competition and regularly update and optimize your profiles on these platforms to improve visibility and attract recruiters.

### Conclusion
This project highlights the essential factors for navigating a data-related career. It combines data analysis and visualization to guide aspiring professionals in making informed decisions about their career paths. I hope it inspires others to embrace this field, master the necessary skills, and achieve their career goals.
