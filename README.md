# My_Project_2023_Data_Jobs_Analysis
## Project Overview
As an aspiring data analyst and former job seeker, I created this project to provide valuable insights into data-related careers. By analyzing it using my skills in Excel (Power Query, Data Analysis Tool), ETL, Power BI (DAX, Data Visualization), and Structured Query Language (SQL). The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from GitHub Luke Barousse, I explored key aspects such as the types of available data jobs, required technical skills, optimal times to apply, the correlation between skills and salary, and popular job posting platforms.
